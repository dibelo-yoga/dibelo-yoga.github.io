        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Dimitris Dibelo is a globally-renowned yoga teacher with over a
            decade of experience. His journey into yoga began at the age of 23
            when he encountered serious issues with his lower back and knees.
            Motivated to find a solution, he immersed himself in the practice
            and eventually turned his passion into a career.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dimitris holds a degree in management and has been teaching yoga
            since 2009. He is authorized by Yoga Alliance as an Experienced
            Registered Yoga Teacher (ERYT) at the 500-hour level, allowing him
            to offer trainings in Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga and Hatha Yoga and owner
            of
            <a href="https://hathastudio.gr/" target="_blank" title="Yoga Patra"
              ><strong>Yoga & Pilates Studio.</strong></a
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            With a focus on Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga, Dimitris has developed a deep
            understanding of asana, meditation, pranayama, and yogic philosophy.
            His ability to clearly explain the what, why, and how of these
            practices has garnered him a reputation as a masterful teacher. From
            workshops to teacher trainings, Dimitris's classes are sought after
            worldwide.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dimitris's teaching style is influenced by his teacher, Kristina
            Karitinos Ireland, and complemented by his own Italian temperament
            and sense of humor. His dynamic and playful classes emphasize the
            importance of breath, alignment, and respect for the human body.
          </p>
          <p>
            Continuing his journey of growth and knowledge, Dimitris regularly
            attends yoga workshops, trainings, and has traveled to India for
            immersive learning experiences. He also places great importance on
            integrating Ayurveda – the Science of Life – into his teaching. By
            sharing Ayurvedic wisdom and its healing power in a modern language,
            Dimitris empowers his students to achieve holistic wellbeing. In
            addition to his expertise in Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga and Hatha Yoga,
            Dimitris has a passion for working with athletes. Having personally
            experienced the benefits of yoga in his own athletic pursuits, he
            understands the unique needs and challenges that athletes face.
          </p>

          <p>
            Dimitris offers personalized private yoga classes for athletes that
            target specific areas of focus, such as increasing flexibility,
            improving balance and coordination, building strength and stability,
            and enhancing mental focus. By integrating elements of yoga into an
            athlete's training regimen, Dimitris helps them prevent injuries,
            recover faster, and perform at their peak.
          </p>

          <p>
            Dimitris's approach to teaching yoga goes beyond physical practice.
            He believes in the transformative power of yoga as a tool for
            personal growth and self-discovery. Through his classes, he
            encourages students to cultivate mindfulness, tap into their inner
            strength, and find balance in all aspects of life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dimitris's commitment to his own growth as a teacher is evident in
            his dedication to continued learning and exploration. He regularly
            attends workshops and trainings, not only to expand his knowledge
            but also to refine his teaching skills and deepen his understanding
            of yoga philosophy.

          <h2>Ascend</h2>
          <p>
            Ascent represents the "ascending energy flow" which can be easily
            created during a Vinyasa class. What makes the difference here is
            the "constant 3-partner-interaction" between the yoga teacher, me,
            the DJ and the group.

            We improvise sequences and music according to the students' energy
            at every moment during the 75 minutes that the class lasts. By
            listening to the music, people can travel and elevate their mood
            while doing yoga. The atmosphere changes with the asanas and the
            sequences of exercises and an appropriate rhythm is achieved for
            each level of intensity of the class. This vinyasa music yoga
            practice really opens you up!! The act of synchronizing breathing,
            movement and music really sets you free and energises you ! So, here
            we are, waiting for you ! Prepare for something new and
            revolutionary!
